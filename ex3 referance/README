the files submitted are:
1. Constants.py = a file for saving constants for all other files to use

2.mleTagBaseline = a file meant to implement mle baseline tag model,
is called from main.py and regards question (a) +(b)

2.bigramHMM =  a class file meant to implement the bigram HMM model with optional modifications of smoothing and
  pseudo words is called in main.py and regards questions (c) + (d) + (e)

3. psuedoWords = a class file meant to implement the functionality of  pseudo words on a dataset for model uses
 called in aid of a bigram HMM model in question (e) in main.py

4.main.py = executes all questions using helper methods and above classes

Answers to questions: (a) - (e) Practical part:
